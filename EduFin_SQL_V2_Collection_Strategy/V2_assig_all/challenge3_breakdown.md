# Challenge 3: External Research Integration
## Time-Optimized Contact Strategy Analysis (Perfect ER Diagram Compliance)

### ðŸŽ¯ Business Question & Objective
**Question:** How can we improve our loan collection success rates by implementing research-backed timing strategies and geographic optimization?

**Objective:** Research shows 30% higher success rates with morning calls for certain demographics. We need to modify our contact strategy to:
- Optimize calling times based on employment type and geography
- Batch customers by zones for efficient operations
- Predict expected collection amounts using research multipliers
- Provide resource allocation recommendations

### ðŸ“Š Tables Used (Based on Perfect 3NF ER Diagram)
- **CUSTOMERS**: Customer demographics, employment, income, location data
- **LOANS**: Loan details, status, amounts for collection tracking
- **DEFAULTS_COLLECTIONS**: Default and collection tracking with customer and loan FKs
- **PAYMENTS**: Payment history and methods
- **INSTITUTIONS**: Institution details for loan origination
- **DIM_CITY**: City master data with state FK (Bridge Table)
- **DIM_STATE**: State information with region classification (Bridge Table)
- **GEOGRAPHIC_DEMOGRAPHICS**: Population and demographic data per city
- **ECONOMIC_INDICATORS**: Economic context per state by quarter

### C3-A: Customer Contact Optimization Foundation
**Purpose:** Extract defaulted customers with optimal contact timing based on employment and location
